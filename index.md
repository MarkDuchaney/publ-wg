## Our Mission

> The mission of the [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg) is to enable all publications — with all their specificities and traditions — to become first-class entities on the Web. The WG will provide the necessary technologies on the Open Web Platform to make the combination of traditional publishing and the Web complete in terms of accessibility, usability, portability, distribution, archiving, offline access, and reliable cross referencing.


The Co-Chairs of the Working Group are [Tzviya Siegman](mailto:tsiegman@wiley.com)  (Wiley), and [Garth Conboy](mailto:garth@google.com) (Google). The W3C Staff Contact for the Working Group is [Ivan Herman](mailto:ivan@w3.org). The group is chartered until the 1st of July, 2020.
