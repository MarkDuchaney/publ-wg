### 1. Packaging format
{: #section1}

**Wendy Reid:** howdy  
… thanks for coming on short notice. We've had a lot of conversations on email and github  

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/wiki/Packaging-for-WP-Audiobooks](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/wiki/Packaging-for-WP-Audiobooks)

**Wendy Reid:** I created a wiki page for packaging  

**Dave Cramer:** A lot of this was thrown together quickly and I would encourage others to edit and provide suggestions for how to make it more helpful. This is the 5 parsec view  

**Ivan Herman:** there should be one more row  
… how difficult would it be for a community to transition to a particular format?  

**Wendy Reid:** perhaps today we can discuss this, as we are still fresh from Monday's meeting?  

**Laurent Le Meur:** I did a summary of OCF solution, dividing into the 3  
… we could take OCF 3.2, and remove everything in it that has to do with EPUB, META-INF, file extension, and mime-type  
… the end result is that there would be almost nothing left  
… we'd need another doc for the well-known locations for index and manifest  
… a second choice would be to extend OCF 3.2  
… and to extend it for audio pub, we would have to segment it  
… we use zip, we are careful about some constraints  
… 2nd part would be about epub features  
… 3rd part would be about audio features--well-known locations  
… a common part about zip, and then a choice: EPUB or audio  
… third solution is to take OCF 3.2, copy it, and in this new doc remove EPUB stuff and add Audio stuff  
… a clean doc that is only for audio  

**Ivan Herman:** I am for option 3, and the reason is that we should keep away from the impression that we redefine anything for EPUB 3  
… but it will confuse a lot of people  
… OCF 3.2 is part of the CG output, and we should not change it  
… if we do option 3, we are clean  

> *Avneesh Singh:* +1,keep away from perception of touching EPUB 3.2

**Laurent Le Meur:** I agree  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* +1 ivan

**Wendy Reid:** it's important to keep it separate  

**Laurent Le Meur:** if we choose option 3, we can either replicate all the information in OCF about Unicode, or make reference to the ISO standard that adds the same constraints  
… but we have to study the difference between OCF wording and the ISO wording  

**Ivan Herman:** let's stay on stable ground and look to EPUB's version  

**Wendy Reid:** +1  

**Laurent Le Meur:** this would be easier to edit  

**Dave Cramer:** It seems like what we are calling OCF lite has very little OCF in it  
… in the days of OEB you would put the package file and content in a zip, OCF came about because of all of the other things you would want to do (encryption, obfuscation, etc)  
… if we do this we have a very light implementation  
… every reading system is dependent on the mimetype  

**Wendy Reid:** I do have an answer on mimetype for Kobo  
… I talked to our ingestion team  
… from the app and ingestion perspective, it would be possible to not use these  
… we just use it for validation  

**Ivan Herman:** dauwhe is correct on the technical content  
… I had a discussion Ralph yesterday about the  admin side  
… we have to be careful, in the charter of the WG it says we don't define a packaging format, because such work is happening elsewhere  
… we could say we try to use OCF for now and we need a deployment strategy  
… and we could publish something as a note  
… and when Web packaging comes into the picture, we'd revisit  
… so we have to be careful what we call it  
… using OCF-lite reminds the community we are reusing something that exist  
… let sleeping dogs lie  

**Laurent Le Meur:** two things  
… re: charter, I see that this group has to create a packaged web pub and EPUB 4  
… which means choosing a packaging mechanism  
… I don't see anything that forbids choosing a packaging mechanism  

**Ivan Herman:** choosing is different than defining  
… and this came up during chartering. There be dragons.  

**Laurent Le Meur:** the other was about mimetype  
… dauwhe, you tried removing  
… did you try moving the mimetype?  

**Ivan Herman:** and uncompressed  

**Dave Cramer:** I haven't done a test with the mimetpye in a different position, but I can
... also the restriction of it being uncompressed

**Laurent Le Meur:** we know the only issue for zipper is that you don't know where this files go  

**Ivan Herman:** the uncompressing means you to run things twice  

**Luc Audrain:** it's not exactly the same when we sideload vs when we ingest  
… and distribute  
… I'm not sure that it's exactly the same  
… so the Q of mimetype is probably important for ingestion  

**Laurent Le Meur:** Luc, when you say mimetype is important for ingestion, what do you mean? is it because of epubcheck, or is intrinsic?  

**Luc Audrain:** if I remember the email from Brady, it said the program would not find the real EPUBs  

**Laurent Le Meur:** if any generic ingestion mechanism takes a file, and doesn't look at file extension, and wants to check what kind of file by introspection, then magic numbers are useful  

**Brady Duga:** the purpose of the mimetype is not for people in this room  
… we may find it useless, but it wasn't designed for us.  
… will the world end if there's a zip without a mimetype, so that your email won't open an audio book? No. It will just be messy.  
… it's nice to identify a file, and most files have a trivial way of recognizing them.  
… zip does have the PK sig, so anything will recognize zip  
… it just makes it easier for apps  
… moving it doesn't make the mime type file easier  
… today you have to add it first with uncompressed flag, then add everything else  
… changing the order doesn't make things easier  
… it's still two commands  

**Dave Cramer:** Almost all of the discussion here and in email/github has been about what we call OCF lite, but we seem to be mostly discussing it without deciding that this is the direction we are going in  
… without exploring what our alternatives are  

**Brady Duga:** in general I'm leaning towards option 3  
… I think that's what Garth wanted  
… it would be ideal if we could just reference OCF, but we can't  
… it sounds like option 3 is make our own spec, taking what we want  
… the biggest problem is political  
… clever names might help  
… like OCF-audio  
… the real issue is the politics and the paperwork  

**Ivan Herman:** what would be the difference between OCF-audio and OCF for web publications  
… would the difference be zero?  
… there are a number of properties that audio needs, but it's not dependent on packaging  
… is there anything special about audio that's not true for edu?  

**Laurent Le Meur:** we should first make a note, and then later see if we push it to rec  
… for politics it would be better to make a note for audio and not for web pub  
… we have a short-term use case. If we want to extend it, we can  

**Ivan Herman:** I understand  
… what we put in the note should not be audio-dependent  

**Brady Duga:** the difference to me is whether we reference audiobooks  
… we can make a generic version, that includes a mimetype for the content  
… we'd be making a generic zip-based packaging format  
… if we want an audio-specific format, we could include an audiobook mime type  
… my understanding is that that is easier politically  
… than a generic zip-based packaging format  

**Dave Cramer:** One of my foundational concerns is that whatever solution we adopt for audio will by default become the solution for WP  
… I think there is a significant difference between the audio case and the general WP case  
… roughly encapsulates ideas of security and origin  
… a ZIP-based WP format is going to be challenging from a security POV and gets us no further than EPUB  
… and possibly worse off if we remove the proposed items from OCF  
… we are in a tough position, we want something soon for audiobooks and we're stuck waiting for the better thing that may never come  

> *Brady Duga:* +1 Dave

> *Tzviya Siegman:* +1 dauwhe

**Ivan Herman:** I understand what Dave is saying  
… for the time being, we work as if we are working on audio  
… knowing in our hearts this could be reused  
… but we know this is not an ideal solution  
… then we hope we have a genuine choice in a few years  

> *Luc Audrain:* +1 as we need something now for the industry

**Ivan Herman:** the approach of laurent and brady is probably politically our best choice, even if not optimal  

**George Kerscher:** how is it that we are able to do media overlays in EPUB 3, which are a combo of text and audio, but if you don't have text why isn't this appropriate  

**Ivan Herman:** if we have the definition of audio and media overlays for web publications, there's no reason we can't use it  
… marisa and friends are working on  
… I don't think it won't work  

**George Kerscher:** I mean the packaging aspect  

**Wendy Reid:** you're talking about the DAISY (and Apple) implementation of audio books in EPUB 3  
… I do have this listed as an avenue in the explainer  
… I don't think it is the way it was going to work  
… the companies making audio could have been doing it  

**George Kerscher:** in the context of this discussion, it's just about the packaging? Is it about baggage?  

**Wendy Reid:** we're changing a lot  

**George Kerscher:** that helps me understand, if we're just trying to get rid of the complexity associated with EPUB and media overlays  

**Dave Cramer:** I think George brings up several possible things, audiobooks could happen in EPUB today with media overlays  
… they could happen in EPUB with a small change adding media to spine  
… we could use OCF and have the container.xml point to the manifest file, we can do all of these things  
… the major objection to all of those things is that there are simpler options  
… when I try to convince the audio people at Hachette to use all of these XML files they'll look at me like I'm crazy  

**Brady Duga:** my answer was, square peg, round hole  
… trying to do this with EPUB today would be a pain  
… we'd create baggage around something that wasn't designed for audio-only  
… and existing reading systems wouldn't recognize audio-only EPUBs  
… it would be a pain for both content creators and reading systems  

**George Kerscher:** I'm happy now  

**Deborah Kaplan:** I'm grateful to george for the clarifying questions  

**Wendy Reid:** this is hard stuff. ask lots of questions!  

**Ivan Herman:** the question of george also is relevant in one other aspect  
… as dave said, there are other options  
… what was the name of dsinger's latest stuff? HEIF?  

**Laurent Le Meur:** it's a high-fidelity image format  
… it's a format for one type of media only  

**Dave Cramer:** I think dsinger's point is the technology of HEIF could be used to package any sort of resource including audio, video, HTML  
… it's basically an ISO -based media format that underlies the various MPEG things, we could do everything we envision with it  
… I've been trying to learn about it and it has been difficult  

**Wendy Reid:** I've reached out to dsinger to come to a WG meeting  
… so hopefully he can provide an overview on this topic, because the rest of us are (cough) less than expert  
… I want a resolution of some sort  
… I'm not against exploring other options. OCF-audio sounds like what we're working for  
… but we can keep looking. We don't have enough information.  
… does anyone want to take on the task of defining what OCF-audio would look like?  
… it would require a new issue  
… clearly defining what we need for OCF-audio, so we can come back in a couple weeks with a proposal  
… any volunteers?  

**Laurent Le Meur:** I ccan make a draft of ocf-audio  
… with OCF 3.2 as base  

**Tzviya Siegman:** I will work on organizing things with dsinger  

**Dave Cramer:** I think we have a multiplicity of options, even without making a final decision it sounds like we have rejected some options  
… like OCF 3.2  
… I think it's critical that we document our decisions and explain why we're rejecting certain approaches  
… like m4b, which is an already existing format for audiobooks  

**Wendy Reid:** I don't think we've rejected m4b  
… based on my limited understanding there might be issues with audio codecs  

**Wendy Reid:** let's document stuff in the wiki  

**Avneesh Singh:** people do want to know why decisions are made  
… we need requirements, success criteria. that should be the starting point.  

**Wendy Reid:** excellent point. I'll add to wiki  

**Laurent Le Meur:** I want to say exactly that.  
… maybe one issue per potential format, one entry in the wiki  
… the issue means that everyone can provide their comments  

**Wendy Reid:** we can have issues for each format, and then decisions can go in wiki  

**Avneesh Singh:** sounds good  

**Wendy Reid:** we'll end a few minutes early. We've made progress on a difficult issue. Thanks everyone!
