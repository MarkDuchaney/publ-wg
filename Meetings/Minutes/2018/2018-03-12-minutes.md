**Tzviya Siegman:** shall we approve the minutes?  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/Meetings/Minu5-tes/2018/2018-03-05-minutes](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/Meetings/Minu5-tes/2018/2018-03-05-minutes)

**Tzviya Siegman:** minutes approved  
… anyone new joining the call this week?  

### 1. F2F Logistics
{: #section1}

**Tzviya Siegman:** let's review some F2F logistics/agenda stuff  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qe8Q8wMC1LKy_-JO-UCy8bFw4D4VN0si1Q5EPW9c-rY/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qe8Q8wMC1LKy_-JO-UCy8bFw4D4VN0si1Q5EPW9c-rY/edit#)

**Tzviya Siegman:** here's a link to F2F info  
… please propose agenda items there  
… please add your name if you're attending  
… Wendy said she will send a link so we can book on our own, but that hasn't happened yet  
… but we need to talk about the agenda  
… we need to think of deliverables for before the F2F  
… one of the goals of the task forces was for them to accomplish something before the F2F  

### 2. Task force plans
{: #section2}

#### 2.1. Affordances
{: #section2-1}

**Tzviya Siegman:** Jasmine/Mateus, can you give us an overview of what you hope to accomplish before the F2F?  

**Mateus Teixeira:** one of our goals is to review open issues, and identify ones that can close  
… and then look at tech requirements for open issues  
… and then have a draft towards completion of the affordances section  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/labels/topic%3Aaffordances](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/labels/topic%3Aaffordances)

> *Mateus Teixeira:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atopic%3Aaffordances](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atopic%3Aaffordances)

**Jasmine Mulliken:** and we hope to do a call this week  

**Mateus Teixeira:** we have a few times that might work  
… having a call this week would make sense, Tuesday or Wednesday  

**Ivan Herman:** I am supposed to set up a webex?  

**Mateus Teixeira:** yes, I'll confirm with you  

**Tzviya Siegman:** there were problems with doodle and DST  

#### 2.2. WAM
{: #section2-2}

**Benjamin Young:** the WAM task force will work on anything tagged with that label  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/labels/topic%3Amanifest](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/labels/topic%3Amanifest)

**Benjamin Young:** we're mostly focusing on direct requests  
… especially things that have applicability outside publishing  

**Ivan Herman:** did I miss a call for timing?  

**Benjamin Young:** there's a doodle poll; there will be an email about a call soon  
… we'll go through the list on the first call  
… then work on github, then a follow-up call  

**Tzviya Siegman:** anything else as a deliverable?  

> *Dave Cramer:* (silence)

### 3. Issues proposed for closure
{: #section3}

**Tzviya Siegman:** last week, ivan put together a list of issues that were closable  
… we can spend the rest of the meeting closing issues  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://gist.github.com/iherman/581247543c670faa30f1ab89ff1c11eb](https://gist.github.com/iherman/581247543c670faa30f1ab89ff1c11eb)

**Ivan Herman:** the low-number issues were the ones that led to long discussions  
… my tendency would be to close those  

**Tzviya Siegman:** I don't think it's a good use of time to read through every comment of issue 1 :)  

> *Peter Krautzberger:* I've been following on github so I assume I have.

**Tzviya Siegman:** I don't think it's a good use of time to read through the list  

**Garth Conboy:** or do we want to close them and wait for complaints?  

**Tzviya Siegman:** I don't think it's productive for me to read issues  

> *Dave Cramer:* [https://gist.github.com/iherman/581247543c670faa30f1ab89ff1c11eb](https://gist.github.com/iherman/581247543c670faa30f1ab89ff1c11eb)

**Garth Conboy:** read the issues not the topics?  

#### 3.1. Issue 1 (i18n of metadata values, in case JSON is chosen as a serialization format)
{: #section3-1}

> *Dave Cramer:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/1](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/1)

**Tzviya Siegman:** Issue 1; do we agree to close it?  

**Tzviya Siegman:** the other issue is PR 129???  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/pull/129](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/pull/129)

**Deborah Kaplan:** ivan has made notes about why these are closable  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** Ivan and myself has introduced new language in the draft to deal with this  

**Tzviya Siegman:** I'm seeing agreement to close #1  

**Brady Duga:** do all these issues have your summaries?  

**Ivan Herman:** yes  

> ***Resolution #1: close issue 1***
{: #resolution1 .resolution}

#### 3.2. issue 2 (Navigating a web publication)
{: #section3-2}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/2](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/2)

**Tzviya Siegman:** navigating a web pub; this is obsoleted by the current infoset and the affordances discussion  
… it's covered in our doc  

> *Ivan Herman:* proposed closing

> ***Resolution #2: close issue 2***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

#### 3.3. issue 9 (Machine-Readable navigation)
{: #section3-3}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/9](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/9)

**Tzviya Siegman:** machine readable navigation  
… the comments lost focus, let's close and create more focused issues  
… we should look more closely  
… Avneesh, could you look at this and see if it needs new issues  

> *Rachel Comerford:* +1 to closing issue and opening specific tickets

**Avneesh Singh:** it has grown in too many directions  

**Benjamin Young:** there's still tension about where things come from  
… the machine-readable-navigation things  
… some like nav stuff from HTML, others want it expressed in JSON  

**Tzviya Siegman:** that has been picked up in other issues around webidl  

**Benjamin Young:** I'll try to link back  

> *Mateus Teixeira:* +1 to closing 9 & reopening focused issues or moving discussions to other open issues

> ***Resolution #3: close 9 and open new issues if needed***
{: #resolution3 .resolution}

#### 3.4. issue 13 (Associating a manifest with publication resources)
{: #section3-4}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/13](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/13)

**Tzviya Siegman:** associating manifest with pub resources  

> **Proposed resolution: close the issue** *(Ivan Herman)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

**Tzviya Siegman:** any comments?  

> ***Resolution #4: close  issue 13***
{: #resolution4 .resolution}

#### 3.5. issue 22 (manifest: requirements for offline)
{: #section3-5}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/22](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/22)

**Tzviya Siegman:** manifest requirements for offline  
… the issue has lost focus  
… we should go through and make sure everything necessary is covered  
… jasminemulliken, can this be part of the affordances task force  

**Jasmine Mulliken:** I don't see why not  

> ***Resolution #5: issue 22 will be closed by Jasmine, and if necessary new issues opened***
{: #resolution5 .resolution}

#### 3.6. issue 23 (MUST the manifest include information about secondary resources or not?)
{: #section3-6}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/23](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/23)

**Tzviya Siegman:** must manifest include secondary resources?  

**Ivan Herman:** the secondary resources are part of the infoset  

> ***Resolution #6: close issue 23***
{: #resolution6 .resolution}

#### 3.7. issue 39 (Do all documents in the reading order have to be reachable from the ToC)
{: #section3-7}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/39](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/39)

**Tzviya Siegman:** do all docs in reading order have to be reachable from TOC  
… this is covered in our current draft  

**Tzviya Siegman:** any comments about closing this issue?  

> ***Resolution #7: close issue 39***
{: #resolution7 .resolution}

#### 3.8. issue 69 (Naming the media overlay work)
{: #section3-8}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/69](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/69)

**Tzviya Siegman:** this is now a separate CG for Media Overlays  
… marisa, can you drop a link to the CG?  

> ***Resolution #8: close issue 69***
{: #resolution8 .resolution}

> *Marisa DeMeglio:* [https://www.w3.org/community/sync-media-pub/](https://www.w3.org/community/sync-media-pub/)

> *Luc Audrain:* I’m in and not a DAISY member…

#### 3.9. issue 70 (Relationship to the Web Animation work)
{: #section3-9}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/70](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/70)

**Tzviya Siegman:** this is also part of the CG for Media Overlays  

> ***Resolution #9: close issue 70***
{: #resolution9 .resolution}

#### 3.10. issue 72 (MathML and WPUB)
{: #section3-10}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/72](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/72)

**Tzviya Siegman:** mathml and web publications  
… the issues of math are not in scope for this WG  

> *Bill Kasdorf:* I would suggest MathML is a best practices issue

**Tim Cole:** I agree with closing it, but am concerned with the language  
… mathML being a problem is the implication  
… it sounds like it's being closed with prejudice  

**Tzviya Siegman:** timCole, can you add a comment to the issue?  

**George Kerscher:** I agree it should be closed  
… we may find that the CG on best practices will bring us solutions  

> *Charles LaPierre:* DIAGRAM Center is working on this as well as a best practice and will share our solution with you all soon.

> ***Resolution #10: close issue 72 but Tim Cole will add comments***
{: #resolution10 .resolution}

> *Zheng Xu:* so I hope can know where will this problem go?

> *Zheng Xu:* Because we have a lot of problem of supporting MathML

> *Zheng Xu:* done

**Bill Kasdorf:** my suggestion is that DAISY's work is relevant, and about to be public, and belongs in the best practices work of the CG  

**Avneesh Singh:** MathML is the current state, it is the best way for a11y, and belongs to EPUB3CG  
… for PWG we just need to keep an eye on math in general; this issue can be closed  

**Tzviya Siegman:** I think zheng_xu is speaking as a reading system developer for supporting math ml rather than supplying mathml  

> *Zheng Xu:* Yes. Thanks tzviya

**Ivan Herman:** the point is that, this WG cannot solve this problem  
… I agree it's a major problem, there are discussions outside this WG, I hope they lead somewhere  
… but it can't be this WG's job to solve the problem. that's why the issue should be closed.  

#### 3.11. issue 74 (the infoset should not include specialised metadata ???)
{: #section3-11}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/74](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/74)

**Tzviya Siegman:** infoset should not include specialized metadata  
… which was a bit of a misunderstanding?  
… we can link to any metadata in our infoset  
… any comments?  
… the proposal is to close because it is included in our current infoset  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** the concept is that we'll be linking to other metadata, but we haven't discussed how  
… will it be handled by the manifest? there's work on how we handle that.  

**Ivan Herman:** correct. but that was not how the issue was raised.  

**Tzviya Siegman:** we need a more specific issue.  

**Ivan Herman:** do we have it yet?  

**Tzviya Siegman:** the issue we've been talking about with alternate rendering is similar, but not the same  
… if the issue you mentioned isn't open yet, open one  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** we could use the same element to solve both of them  

**Tzviya Siegman:** let's open separate issues  

**Ivan Herman:** the one in 74 was in a much more general level, the infoset level  
… on that level we have consensus that we can refer to ONIX or whatever  
… the details are still to be worked out  
… but 74 is not about that  

**Tzviya Siegman:** let's open a new issue, and to see the problem stated. if there's a proposed solution it can be a comment  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** yes, but we do need the big picture  

**Ivan Herman:** isn't that part of the serialization details  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** it's more related to the infoset  

**Tzviya Siegman:** I would prefer to see the solution separate from the question  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** we've said we won't have specialized metadata, but we haven't said how to point to the metadata  

**Deborah Kaplan:** I like the separation; hadrien's concerns can be addressed by linking... "see main justification for this at link X"  

**Tzviya Siegman:** if you want to leave the issue open, leave comments  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** I can open a new one  

> ***Resolution #11: close issue 74***
{: #resolution11 .resolution}

**Tzviya Siegman:** and Hadrien will open a new issue on how to do this  

#### 3.12. issue 121 (Working out the manifest life cycle)
{: #section3-12}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/121](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/121)

**Tzviya Siegman:** this is in the current draft  

**Ivan Herman:** we should have closed this when the PR for the lifecycle section was accepted  

> ***Resolution #12: close 121***
{: #resolution12 .resolution}

#### 3.13. issue 124 (Expressing metadata in multiple scripts/languages)
{: #section3-13}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/124](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/124)

**Tzviya Siegman:** expressing metadata in multiple language  

**Dave Cramer:** we're closing 124 for the same reason as 121?  

**Ivan Herman:** yes  

> ***Resolution #13: close issue 124***
{: #resolution13 .resolution}

### 4. Issues that _may_ be closed
{: #section4}

#### 4.1. issue 4 (Who is responsible for a publication's user interface?)
{: #section4-1}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/4](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/4)

**Tzviya Siegman:** this is a precursor to the affordances task force  
… we've revisited over and over  
… I think it's a good idea to close  
… and the affordances TF will make us more comfortable with this; the TF can see if there's anything useful in here  

**Jasmine Mulliken:** we'll take a look  

**Tzviya Siegman:** any objections to closing this, and opening new issues as affordances?  

> ***Resolution #14: close issue 4***
{: #resolution14 .resolution}

#### 4.2. issue 5 (How do we identify a web publication and its components?)
{: #section4-2}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/5](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/5)

**Tzviya Siegman:** how to identify a WPUB and its components  
… tim handled this with his doc, and there's stuff in the infoset  
… I think we're covered here?  

**Tim Cole:** I think there are open aspects of this issue, but I don't think it's settled  

**Tzviya Siegman:** can you go through this and open new issues?  
… over next 2-3 weeks?  

**Benjamin Young:** I've been posted related thoughts to PWPUB repo... this identification of the parts as well as the whole matters  
… the google web package formats doesn't provide inter-pub links  

**Tzviya Siegman:** any other comments?  

> ***Resolution #15: Tim Cole to review issue 5, and close after perhaps opening new issues***
{: #resolution15 .resolution}

#### 4.3. issue 35 (Proposal: an HTML-first Table of Contents approach to Web Publication)
{: #section4-3}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/35](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/35)

**Tzviya Siegman:** this does seem to be different than our current proposal  

**Ivan Herman:** dauwhe and bigbluehat started this  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* avk bigbluehat

**Benjamin Young:** I've continued to experiment with this in Dave's html-first repo, on how to enable to have browsers discover this progressively  
… it's helped inform what I'm looking at with the WAM task force  
… if we hoist a WP out of an HTML doc  
… but HTML is the foundational layer we build on  
… with hypermedia as a foundational affordance  
… to the issue at hand, that would be the operating understanding expressed in terms of a fallback  
… I'd love to explore this more as a group  
… we still have yet to touch on DOM affordances, and how a web publication might understand itself and how it might be influenced by JS  
… I would like to explore this, and have demos before the F2F  

**Ivan Herman:** what do we do with this issue?  

**Benjamin Young:** I'm ok with closing it  
… it's still a proposal  

**Benjamin Young:** if rebooting with a fresh start would be helpful, than I'm ok with it  

**Tzviya Siegman:** ivan proposes to close, is that OK/  

> ***Resolution #16: close issue 35***
{: #resolution16 .resolution}

### 5. Misc
{: #section5}

> *Garth Conboy:* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qe8Q8wMC1LKy_-JO-UCy8bFw4D4VN0si1Q5EPW9c-rY/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qe8Q8wMC1LKy_-JO-UCy8bFw4D4VN0si1Q5EPW9c-rY/edit#)

**Garth Conboy:** the closing homework for non-chair-folk is to comment in the document we looked at initially for agenda items  

**George Kerscher:** I'll be at Web Accessibility Initiative F2F next week on guidelines 3.0 development  
… and I'll be emailing Avneesh on points we want to get into their roadmap that are important to publishing  

#### 5.1. MathML
{: #section5-1}

**Zheng Xu:** another comment about #72 (MathML)  
… I can understand that MathML isn't in the scope of the wg  
… what group or task force should we work with?  
… we have lots of publishers using MathML  

> *Dave Cramer:* .. we are using JS liberary in Chrome, I would like to see better support in browsers

**Zheng Xu:** where should this issue go? Which group does this belong to?  

> *Tim Cole:* Another Community Group [https://w3c.github.io/mathonwebpages/](https://w3c.github.io/mathonwebpages/)

**Hadrien Gardeur:** readium take on MathML: we polyfilled with MathJax, in Readium 2 we won't polyfill, we'lll be limited to what the browser can do  
… but this is an issue for web as a whole  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://mathml.igalia.com/](https://mathml.igalia.com/)

**Avneesh Singh:** the screenreaders support MathML, so if browser exposes than JAWS can use  
… it's not only the reading system, it's the screenreader  

**Zheng Xu:** it's very slow  

**Tzviya Siegman:** I've posted some links. there's a math CG, etc.  
… w3c is aware of the problem  

**Zheng Xu:** maybe there can be a joint task force with other groups  

**Tzviya Siegman:** ivan will pay attention to this  
… thanks all. work on the F2F agenda.
