# F2F Meeting in Toronto, May 30-31, 2018

**Location**:
* Rakuten Kobo
* 135 Liberty St, Toronto, ON M6K 1Y7
* See [Google map](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/135+Liberty+St,+Toronto,+ON+M6K+1Y7,+Canada/@43.6396798,-79.4233743,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b3507111f36b5:0xbc547fc483db4da4!8m2!3d43.6372845!4d-79.4234601?hl=en)

**Some hotels**:

Hotels (figures in USD). Listed here in order of what may be the best fit. The first one is 12 minutes from the office by car/cab, 15-20 minutes by transit or a 35-40 minute walk. As you are likely aware Toronto is big in a geographical sense. Kobo's office is significantly west of downtown but that’s where all the hotels are so I’d suggest something downtown, there’s really nothing right by the office.
 
- Hyatt Regency Toronto $240 https://toronto.regency.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html reasonably priced and a good location
- Executive Hotel Cosmopolitan Toronto $213 http://www.cosmotoronto.com/default.htm same as above but farther east
- Le Germain Hotel Toronto $313 http://www.legermainhotels.com/en/torontomercer/ same approximate location as #1 but pricier
- Intercontinental Toronto Centre $243 http://www.torontocentre.intercontinental.com/#gref about 5 minutes south of King
- One King West Hotel & Residence $285 https://www.onekingwest.com/ on King but farther East
- The Gladstone $197 http://www.gladstonehotel.com/ unlikely to fit everyone but it’s a cool west end hotel near the office
- RADISSON ADMIRAL HOTEL TORONTO-HARBOURFRONT $215 https://www.radisson.com/toronto-hotel-on-m5j2n5/ontoront/hotel a bit far south (maybe a 10 minute walk from King which you’d need to get up to in order to get across to the Kobo office)

**Airport information**

- Billy Bishop which is downtown on the water. It’s really easy to get in and out of as well as to and from the hotels. The catch is they tend to use smaller planes (those who don’t like flying might want to avoid it) and flight availability is not as good as Pearson.
- Pearson which is North West of the city and where most of the flights come in to. It’s a pretty typical airport in terms of hassle and size.
