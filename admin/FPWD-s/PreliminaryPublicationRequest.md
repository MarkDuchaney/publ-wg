To be sent as soon as the documents pass pubrules

----

Denis,

this is just a preliminary publication request. The Publishing Working Group has requested a FPWD transition for three documents[1], to be published on the Thursday, 4 of January. The two documents are:

- Web Publications:
- Packaged Web Publications:
- Locators for Web Publications

The two document snapshots are already available

- https://w3c.github.io/wpub/?specStatus=FPWD
- https://w3c.github.io/pwpub/?specStatus=FPWD
- https://w3c.github.io/publ-loc/?specStatus=FPWD

And I will put them on the /TR/2018/ as soon as we have the Director's decision.

All three documents go through pubrule's checker. 

Thank you!

Ivan
