# Transition Request: three documents of the Publishing Working Group to FPWD

Philippe and Ralph,

The Web Publication Working Group has resolved [1-3] to request publication of a FPWD of:

    - Web Publications:
        - https://w3c.github.io/wpub/?specStatus=FPWD
    - Packaged Web Publications:
        - https://w3c.github.io/pwpub/?specStatus=FPWD
    - Locators for Web Publications
        - https://w3c.github.io/publ-loc/?specStatus=FPWD
    
Since this is the first publication of this document, please approve the shortnames: wpub, pwpub, and publ-loc, respectively.

The estimated publication date is 4 January 2018 (confirmed with the Webmaster). The documents will be generated with the proper date and publication status accordingly.

Note that the third document (Locators) is not explicitly listed in the WG's charter[4]. However, that document is a 'spin-off' from the first document (Web Publication); the group judged that keeping it in the original document could, editorially, create an imbalance for that specification. (The charter[4] allows for such splits.)

There were no Formal Objections to publishing these FPWDs.

This request is sent per "How to Organize a Technical Report Transition" [4].

For the co-Chairs of the Web Publications Working Group,
Ian Jacobs
