## First Public Working Draft: Web Publications, Packaged Web Publications, and Web Annotation Extensions for Web Publications

The [W3C Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/) has published three First Public Working Drafts today.

* The [Web Publications](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-wpub-20180104) defines a collection of information that describes the structure of Web Publications such that user agents can provide user experiences well-suited to reading publications, such as sequential navigation and offline reading. This information set includes the default reading order, a list of resources, and publication-wide metadata.

* The [Packaged Web Publications](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-pwpub-20180104) defines a packaging format for combining the resources of a Web Publication [wpub] into a single portable file.

* The [Web Annotation Extensions for Web Publications](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-wpub-ann-20180104) extends the foundational model that has been developed in the [Web Annotation Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) Recommendation by adding selector types applicable to collective resources and a new model component for describing positions in text and byte streams.

The Working Group welcomes comments via the GitHub repository issues (see the respective documentsâ€™ headers for the reference of the repositories).
